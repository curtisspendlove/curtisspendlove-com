To-Do:
	Consulting:
		- Move "Month" name inside the availability bars
		- Add slight (light) border to availability bars, showing clearly week delineators
	Articles:
		- Polish "25M of Rock" @due(04-28-2016)
	Jekyll:
		- Add feature to "future" / "drafts" to specify a date limit
			For instance, I'd like to be able to preview what my site will look like after tomorrow's build. I need to be able to project to a date in the future (next week, or Thursday to see that day's posts).
