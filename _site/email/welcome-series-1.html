      <h1 id="environment">Environment</h1>

<p>In Lesson 1 we explore a typical, but bare minimum, development environment suitable for building static websites. In the future, we’ll expand this environment with additional tools to support building more complex, dynamic websites.</p>

<p>The absolute minimum set of tools needed are a basic text editor, a distributed version control system, and a hosting platform. (Although not <strong>exactly</strong> essential, a version control protocol is <em>highly</em> suggested. And since our choice—Github—just happens to also easily host static websites, it’s perfect for our objectives.)</p>

<h2 id="version-control-github">Version Control (Github)</h2>

<p>Over the course of the past decade <a href="https://git-scm.com">git</a> claimed the throne as the de-facto standard distributed version control system. Likewise, <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> surfaced as the canonical option to host both public and private source code repositories.</p>

<p>Eventually we’ll explore additional options, but you really <em>should</em> have a Github presence if your ultimate goal is to get hired as a professional software developer.</p>

<p>Head on over to the Github web application and create an account. This process is fairly straight forward, but if you get stuck Github has excellent <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/">support documentation</a>. (Insert link for getting started with github blog post.)</p>

<h2 id="development-cloud9">Development (Cloud9)</h2>

<p>In recent years the advent of “Cloud IDEs” redefined and simplified the concept of a common development environment, accessible from nearly any computing device.</p>

<p>Although fierce competition ensues in the Cloud IDE realm, <a href="https://c9.io">Cloud 9</a>is a solid contender and tied as my favorite Cloud IDE.</p>

<p>Like Github, Cloud 9 offers <a href="https://c9.io/web/sign-up/free">free accounts</a>for public and low-usage scenarios. Again this process is fairly straight forward, but if you get stuck Cloud 9 also has excellent <a href="https://docs.c9.io/docs/getting-started">support documentation</a>.</p>

<h2 id="hosting-github-pages">Hosting (Github Pages)</h2>

<p>It’s no surprise that Github is a powerful force in the software development community. They provide significant benefits to all members of their platform.</p>

<p>We will learn to interact with Github at a lower level in later lessons. However, for our first repository, we’ll create a traditional “Hello, World” project using the Github web interface.</p>

<p>An added benefit to this process is automatic integration with the <a href="https://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a> hosting platform.</p>

<p>As Github has excellent documentation, we’ll go ahead and follow their <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/">hello world</a> example.</p>

<p>In the following steps, we dive into the technical (my mentoring philosophy is “jump into the fire”, but we’ll jump together) aspects of building a basic website. If this is the first time you’ve done this, this process might take some time, even some trial and error.</p>

<p>Please keep in mind, even though this may be challenging, nothing is <strong>forever</strong> in the software development realm. You can easily modify code, or even wipe out the repository and start over from scratch if you feel nuking and paving is necessary.</p>

<p>If you feel frustrated, please consult the <em>Resources</em> section at the bottom of this email. There are a few additional resources, including a screencast video, to help you out.</p>

<h3 id="create-a-new-page">Create a New Page</h3>

<p>Now that you’re sporting a <a href="https://github.com/knightotoldcode/hello-world">shiny sample repository</a>, let’s soup it up a bit and make a hosted website out of it.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click “New file”</li>
  <li>Enter the name of the file “index.html” (above the file editor pane)</li>
  <li>Add the following text:</li>
</ol>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">	<span class="cp">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
	<span class="nt">&lt;html</span> <span class="na">lang=</span><span class="s">"en"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
	  <span class="nt">&lt;head&gt;</span>
	    <span class="nt">&lt;meta</span> <span class="na">charset=</span><span class="s">"utf-8"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
	    <span class="nt">&lt;title&gt;</span>Hello, World!<span class="nt">&lt;/title&gt;</span>
	  <span class="nt">&lt;/head&gt;</span>
	  <span class="nt">&lt;body&gt;</span>
	    Hello, World!
	  <span class="nt">&lt;/body&gt;</span>
	<span class="nt">&lt;/html&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>(Feel free to customize this, for example, perhaps add your name and some personal information.)</p>

<h3 id="commit-the-new-page">Commit the New Page</h3>

<p>We entered the page and its content in the Github web interface.</p>

<p>(The Github web application is actually quite powerful for being able to interact with your repositories through a standard web interface. In the future, however, we’ll explore much more powerful methods to control your source code.)</p>

<p>In git, when we want to solidify changes to a source code file (like our new index.html file), we <em>commit</em> it. The simplest way to do this is to use the “Commit directly to the master branch” option in the “Commit new file” panel.</p>

<p>(If you look at my repository, I’ve used the more advanced “Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request.” option. As a professional software developer, I try to use pull requests and other industry-standard practices as often as possible. However, this is an advanced topic we will cover in more detail later. I mention it here simply for awareness, in case your repository differs slightly from mine.)</p>

<h3 id="trigger-github-pages">Trigger Github Pages</h3>

<p>There are two ways to trigger the built-in Github Pages platform: a certain repository name, and ensuring a hostible website is in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">gh-pages</code> branch.</p>

<p>Since we followed the Github repository tutorial above, our repository is most likely named something like <code class="highlighter-rouge">hello-world</code>. This is fine, we can turn it into a hosted page by ensuring we have the site code in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">gh-pages</code> branch.</p>

<h4 id="create-gh-pages-branch">Create <code class="highlighter-rouge">gh-pages</code> Branch</h4>

<p>The Github web interface contains everything we need to create the appropriate branch.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Ensure you have the <em>index.html</em> file listed in your repository.</li>
  <li>Click the “Branch: master” dropdown near the ‘New pull request’ button.</li>
  <li>In the input box labeled “Find or create branch”, type: “gh-pages”.</li>
</ol>

<p>This should create the new branch and copy your existing code into it.</p>

<h3 id="preview-the-hosted-site">Preview the Hosted Site</h3>

<p>The presence of a <code class="highlighter-rouge">gh-pages</code> branch should indicate to Github Pages that you want a website hosted from this repository. The little robots housed at the Github campus will kick in and build the website in a location available to the greater web.</p>

<p>We can verify this by clicking the “Settings” tab below the “Un/watch”, “Star”, and “Fork” buttons.</p>

<p>The Settings page should indicate “Your site is published at: http://username.github.io/repository-name” under the Github Pages panel.</p>

<p>Clicking this link should take you to your new page in your web browser.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In Lesson 1 we created accounts on Github and Cloud 9, which will be useful for future lessons. We also created a basic “Hello, World” style example site on Github Pages (the free platform we’ll be using to host the full website created throughout this series).</p>

<p>The next lesson explores fleshing-out the “Hello, World” website into a more cohesive one. We will learn what the code in “index.html” actually does, and prepare for future lessons to create “About” and “Contact” pages.</p>
