Over the course of the past decade [git](https://git-scm.com) claimed the throne as the de-facto standard distributed version control system. Likewise, [Github](https://github.com) surfaced as the canonical option to host both public and private source code repositories.

## Create Your Github Account

Using Github is a fairly painless process. Creating an account is a straight-forward process. Simply enter the requested information and click the giant “Sign Up” button.

Assuming all is well, you should be forwarded to a successful welcome page explaining a bit about the service.

It’s a good idea to read through this information (at least skim it for future reference) so that you’re aware of the potential features. We’ll highlight a few key points:

* **Choose your personal plan:** It’s notable that Github has paid plans with various costs for associated “private” repositories. By default, everything on Github is public (often used for open-source projects). If you *don't’* want your code visible, you’ll need to pick a paid plan. But for now, it’s sufficient to select the *free* plan. (After all, you **want** your personal portfolio projects visible to the public.)
* **Help me set up an organization next:** It’s unlikely that you’re going to be running an organization on Github at this early phase, but if you plan to it *is* a possibility and they’ll walk you through it if you check this button.

After selecting your preferences, click the “Finish sign up” button to advance to your Dashboard.

## Your Github Dashboard

You should be welcomed into the loving arms of the dashboard page. You’ll probably spend a reasonable time with some version of this page.

The first time you arrive here, you’ll likely have the welcome banner at the top, inviting you to get started with the [Hello World guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/). While you don’t need to complete this immediately, I recommend completing this as a “next step” at the conclusion of this article.

You can click the “X” button in the top-right of the “Get Started” banner to dismiss it (don’t fret, you can always return to the Hello World guide in the future with the link above).

You’re now staring at the standard dashboard page. As you use Github, this page transforms into a customized portal filled with activity from the projects you work on.

## Your Welcome Email

Like nearly every web service Github will send you a verification email. As stated click the large “Verify” button to launch a link in your browser, validating the email address for your account.

You may have to sign in for security purposes. After you do so, Github should present you with your dashboard and notification that your email was verified.

## Next Steps

We’ve learned how to create a Github account and explored the signup sequence. (These concepts form a basis of some tasks we’ll perform with your personal branding website in the future. So it’s fun and informative to experience them.)

If you haven’t already done so, I would recommend the following step(s) to gain additional familiarity with the Github service.
